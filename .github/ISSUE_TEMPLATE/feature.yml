      For example, if I'd wish to include a new environment suite, like `gymnax`,
      I'd type a use case I'd like to test:
      ```python
      env, env_params = gymnax.make("Pendulum-v1")
      env = helx.environment.to_helx(env)
      helx.experiment.run(env, helx.agents.Random(env.observation_space, action_space), 10)
      ````
