              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)

              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

# HELX: The RL experiments framework

[![Project Status: WIP – Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)
[![CI](https://github.com/epignatelli/helx/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/epignatelli/helx/actions/workflows/CI.yml)
[![CD](https://github.com/epignatelli/helx/actions/workflows/CD.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/epignatelli/helx/actions/workflows/CD.yml)
![GitHub release (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/epignatelli/helx?color=%23216477&label=Release)

**[Quickstart](#what-is-helx)** | **[Installation](#installation)** | **[Examples](#examples)** | **[Cite](#cite)**

## What is HELX?

HELX is a JAX-based ecosystem providing a standardised framework to run Reinforcement Learning experiments.

The framework has four main parts:
- `base`, containing the base objects of the framework
- `agents`, containing the most common RL baselines
- `envs`, which provides a single API to the most common RL environments (gym, gymnax, dm_env, atari, ...)
- `experiment`, which packs the other three nodes into a framework to run and manage experiments

## Installation

- ### Stable
Install the stable version of `helx` and its dependencies with:
```bash
pip install helx
```

- ### Nightly
Or, if you prefer to install the latest version from source:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/epignatelli/helx
```


---
## Examples

A typical use case is to design an agent, and toy-test it on `catch` before evaluating it on more complex environments, such as atari, procgen or mujoco.

```python
import bsuite
import gym

import helx.environment
import helx.experiment
import helx.agents

# create the enviornment in you favourite way
env = bsuite.load_from_id("catch/0")
# convert it to an helx environment
env = helx.environment.to_helx(env)
# create the agent
hparams = helx.agents.Hparams(env.obs_space(), env.action_space())
agent = helx.agents.Random(hparams)

# run the experiment
helx.experiment.run(env, agent, episodes=100)
```


Switching to a different environment is as simple as changing the `env` variable.


```diff
import bsuite
import gym

import helx.environment
import helx.experiment
import helx.agents

# create the enviornment in you favourite way
-env = bsuite.load_from_id("catch/0")
+env = gym.make("procgen:procgen-coinrun-v0")
# convert it to an helx environment
env = helx.environment.to_helx(env)
# create the agent
hparams = helx.agents.Hparams(env.obs_space(), env.action_space())
agent = helx.agents.Random(hparams)

# run the experiment
helx.experiment.run(env, agent, episodes=100)
```



## Joining development

---
### Adding a new agent (`helx.agents.Agent`)

An `helx` agent interface is designed as the minimal set of functions necessary to *(i)* interact with an environment and *(ii)* reinforcement learn.

```python
from typing import Any
from jax import Array

from helx.base import Timestep
from helx.agents import Agent


class NewAgent(helx.agents.Agent):
    """A new RL agent."""
    def create(self, hparams: Any) -> None:
        """Initialises the agent's internal state (knowledge), such as a table,
        or some function parameters, e.g., the parameters of a neural network."""
        # implement me

    def init(self, key: KeyArray, timestep: Timestep) -> None:
        """Initialises the agent's internal state (knowledge), such as a table,
        or some function parameters, e.g., the parameters of a neural network."""
        # implement me

    def sample_action(
        self, agent_state: AgentState, obs: Array, *, key: KeyArray, eval: bool = False
    ):
        """Applies the agent's policy to the current timestep to sample an action."""
        # implement me

    def update(self, timestep: Timestep) -> Any:
        """Updates the agent's internal state (knowledge), such as a table,
        or some function parameters, e.g., the parameters of a neural network."""
        # implement me
```

---
## Adding a new environment library (`helx.environment.Environment`)

To add a new library requires three steps:
1. Implement the `helx.environment.Environment` interface for the new library.
See the [dm_env](helx/environment/dm_env.py) implementation for an example.
1. Implement serialisation (to `helx`) of the following objects:
    - `helx.environment.Timestep`
    - `helx.spaces.Discrete`
    - `helx.spaces.Continuous`
2. Add the new library to the [`helx.environment.to_helx`](helx/environment/interop.py#L16) function to tell `helx` about the new protocol.

## Cite
If you use `helx` please consider citing it as:

```bibtex
@misc{helx,
  author = {Pignatelli, Eduardo},
  title = {Helx: Interoperating between Reinforcement Learning Experimental Protocols},

## A note on maintainance
This repository was born as the recipient of personal research code that was developed over the years.
Its maintainance is limited by the time and the resources of a research project resourced with a single person.
Even if I would like to automate many actions, I do not have the time to maintain the whole body of automation that a well maintained package deserves.
This is the reason of the WIP badge, which I do not plan to remove soon.
Maintainance will prioritise the code functionality over documentation and automation.

Any help is very welcome.
A quick guide to interacting with this repository:
- If you find a bug, please open an issue, and I will fix it as soon as I can.
- If you want to request a new feature, please open an issue, and I will consider it as soon as I can.
- If you want to contribute yourself, please open an issue first, let's discuss objective, plan a proposal, and open a pull request to act on it.

If you would like to be involved further in the development of this repository, please contact me directly at: `edu dot pignatelli at gmail dot com`.
