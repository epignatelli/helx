### Release
A new version is release at every PR merge to the main branch.
When new commits are added to the main branch, their respective messages are analyses, and can lead to either a new patch, a new minor or a new major version.




### Commits

We employ the [conventional commit](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/%40commitlint/config-conventional) standard for commit messages.
Following this format allows automating the deployment of new releases.
